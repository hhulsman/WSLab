# WSLab Telemetry

## Introduction

WSLab introduced opt-in telemetry collection to better understand impact of WSLab scripts as currently we cannot determine number of VMs deployed or where is WSLab being used. Data sent from scripts are hosted in Azure Application Insights service and it is absolutely transparent what information is being collected, since all code is visible in PowerShell Scripts on Github repository.

Currently there is no public facing interface to read collected information, however in the future plan is to create a public Power BI dashboard, where we will present Leader Boards and usage statistics - such as how many VMs were deployed and we will be able to create statistics that will show in what countries is WSLab running etc.

We are not collecting any PII, whole purpose of this telemetry is to get overall usage statistics of WSLab.

## Verbosity level

Currently there are 3 different verbosity levels for telemetry: **None**, **Basic** and **Full**. If nothing is configured in LabConfig, you will be asked to provide your preferred option. If you would like to skip this interactive prompt completely, configure desired telemetry level in your LabConfig file on per lab basis. You can also configure telemetry behaviour globally using environment variable `WSLAB_TELEMETRY_LEVEL` set to one of three options. If you configure both, LabConfig and Environment variable, LabConfig value take precedence.

### None

If you don't want to send anything, or if you are in an offline environment.

### Basic

Sends information about deployed lab, that is vital for us to understand impact of WSLab scripts.

### Full

Provides enhanced information such as amount of RAM and number of CPU cores of host environment. This information is not essential, however it will provide interesting insight to correlate script performance.

## Tag

If you would like to participate in leaderboard and show how many lab VMs you've deployed, you can also include `TelemetryNickname` variable in LabConfig configuration and this value would be then appended to every telemetry event sent.

## LabConfig examples

Basic telemetry level

```powershell
$LabConfig = @{ 
      DomainAdminName = 'LabAdmin'
      AdminPassword = 'LS1setup!'
      Prefix = 'WSLab-'
      DCEdition = '4'
      Internet = $true
      TelemetryLevel = 'Basic'
      AdditionalNetworksConfig = @()
      VMs = @()
}
 
```

Full telemetry including NickName that will be included in LeaderBoards once we will publish PowerBI statistics.

```powershell
$LabConfig = @{
	DomainAdminName = 'LabAdmin'
	AdminPassword = 'LS1setup!'
	Prefix = 'WSLab-'
	DCEdition = '4'
	Internet = $true
	TelemetryLevel = 'Full'
	TelemetryNickname = 'Jaromirk'
	AdditionalNetworksConfig = @()
	VMs = @()
}
 
```

## Telemetry Events

If WSLab telemetry is enabled, multiple events are sent. All events are listed in the table below. In general when script is started `.Start` type of event is sent and after script sucessfully finished respective `.End` event is sent. Two separate events are used to measure success rate of the scripts.

| Event                     | Script                    | Description |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `Prereq.Start`            | `1_Prereq.ps1`            | When script it started. |
| `Prereq.End`              | `1_Prereq.ps1`            | When all prerequisities are downloaded. |
| `CreateParentDisks.Start` | `2_CreateParentDisks.ps1` | When script it started. |
| `CreateParentDisks.Vhd`   | `2_CreateParentDisks.ps1` | One event per each parent disk. Includes information how long the disk took to hydrate. |
| `CreateParentDisks.End`   | `2_CreateParentDisks.ps1` | When all parent disks are created. |
| `Deploy.Start`            | `3_Deploy.ps1`            | When script it started. |
| `Deploy.VM`               | `3_Deploy.ps1`            | One event per each provisioned lab VM. Includes information about that VM. |
| `Deploy.End`              | `3_Deploy.ps1`            | When lab has been deployed. Includes details about lab (e. g. incremental or new deploy). |
| `Cleanup`                 | `Cleanup.ps1`             | When lab has been deprovisioned. Includes count of actually removed VMs. |
